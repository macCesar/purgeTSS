```scss
// Property: compact
// Description: Setting this to false causes each object key to be displayed on a new line. It will also add new lines to text that is longer than breakLength. If set to a number, the most n inner elements are united on a single line as long as all properties fit into breakLength. Short array elements are also grouped together. No text will be reduced below 16 characters, no matter the breakLength size. For more information, see the example below.
// Component(s): UtilInspectOptions
'.compact': { compact: true }
'.compact-false': { compact: false }
