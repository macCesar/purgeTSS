/**
 * PurgeTSS v7.1.0 - CLI Tool Entry Point
 *
 * PurgeTSS is designed as a CLI-only tool for Titanium Alloy projects.
 * All functionality is accessed through CLI commands:
 *
 * - purgetss              (initialize and purge)
 * - purgetss build        (build tailwind.tss)
 * - purgetss build-fonts  (build fonts)
 * - purgetss module       (install UI modules)
 * - purgetss watch        (setup auto-purging)
 *
 * For programmatic usage, PurgeTSS is not designed as a library.
 * Use the CLI commands from your build scripts instead.
 *
 * @fileoverview CLI tool - not intended for programmatic usage
 * @version 7.1.0

// No exports - PurgeTSS is a CLI-only tool
