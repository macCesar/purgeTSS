## What's New in v7.1.1

**Major Refactoring & ESM Migration**: PurgeTSS v7.1 has been completely refactored with improved code organization, better ESM compatibility, enhanced error handling, and a more intuitive CLI experience.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- **Node.js 16+** required (ESM support)
- **Configuration file**: `config.js` ‚Üí `config.cjs` (same content, different extension for CommonJS compatibility)
- **Removed deprecated commands**:
  - `copy-fonts` (use `icon-library` instead)
  - `build-legacy` (legacy Tailwind build removed)
- **Complete legacy mode removal**:
  - All legacy-related code and conditional checks eliminated
  - Legacy mode no longer supported anywhere in the codebase
  - `purge.options.legacy` configuration option completely removed
- **Simplified font generation**:
  - `build-fonts` `-p` flag removed (now handled by `-f` flag)
  - `build-fonts` command options simplified for better consistency
- **Updated dependencies** to latest ESM versions (chalk v5+, etc.)

### ‚úÖ What's Maintained

- **Same CLI interface** - All commands and options preserved
- **100% API compatibility** - All existing commands work the same
- **Same configuration structure** - Your existing config content works unchanged

### üîÑ Command Improvements

- **Enhanced CLI error handling**: Improved error messages with command suggestions when unknown commands are entered
- **CLI reorganization**: Commands are now organized in logical categories (Setup, Development, Assets, Utilities, Maintenance) for better discoverability
- **`build-fonts` simplified**:
  - Removed `-p` (--icon-prefix-from-filename) flag
  - The `-f` flag now controls both font class names AND icon prefixes using filenames
  - More consistent and intuitive behavior
- **Internal code modularization**: Refactored monolithic helper files into specialized modules for better maintainability
- **Complete legacy mode removal**: Removed `build-legacy` command and all legacy-related code for cleaner, modern codebase

### üîß Migration Guide

For most users, upgrading is seamless:
```bash
npm install -g purgetss@latest
```

**Key changes to note:**
- Only requirement: **Node.js 16 or higher**
- If you used the `build-legacy` command, use the regular `build` command instead
- **Enhanced CLI**: Unknown commands now provide helpful suggestions instead of generic errors
- If you had `legacy: true` in your config, remove this option (legacy mode completely discontinued)
- If you used `build-fonts` with the `-p` flag, now use `-f` instead (handles both font classes and icon prefixes)

- **Shades Command**: The toolkit includes a `shades` command that enables developers to generate custom color shades from a specified hex color, eliminating the need for external tools.
- **Animation Module**: *PurgeTSS* comes with an Animation module to apply basic 2D Matrix animations or transformations to elements or arrays of elements.
