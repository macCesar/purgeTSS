# Key features of PurgeTSS

- Provides more than 18,800 **[Tailwind-like utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/)** ready to be used in your projects.
- Create a clean **`app.tss`** file with only the classes used in your project by parsing all your XML files.
- You can customize any of the default classes via a simple configuration file, or you can create *just-in-time* classes with **arbitrary values** within your `Views`.
- You can easily use fonts from **Font Awesome**, **Material Design** and **Framework7-Icons** on `Buttons` and `Labels`.
- Generates a **`fonts.tss`** file with all class definitions and *fontFamily* selectors for any Icon, Serif, Sans-Serif, Italic, Fancy, or Monospace font.
- Use the `shades` command to generate custom color shades from the given hex color to use in your projects. You no longer need a separate online tool to generate them.
- Includes an **Animation module** to apply basic 2D Matrix animations or transform any element or `Array` of elements.
- Includes a simple two-dimensional **Grid System** to align and distribute elements in your views.
