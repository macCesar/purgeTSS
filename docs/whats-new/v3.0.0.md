## Purge TSS now uses Tailwind CSS v3.0.0
With the release of [Tailwind CSS v3.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3), Purge TSS now uses the revamped colors like cyan, rose, fuchsia, and lime. Check out the [color palette reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) to learn more.

## tailwindUI plug-in is no longer required
Because of this, there are some minor breaking changes:

- These colors are no longer available: lightBlue, warmGray, trueGray, coolGray and blueGray. They are replaced with: sky, stone, neutral, gray and slate respectively.
- Two spacing values are removed: `spacing.13` and `spacing.15`, which means styles for Heights, Widths, Margins and Paddings like `w-13` , `h-13`, `m-15` or `p-15` ( and any other variant like `mt-13`  or `px-13` ) are no longer generated.
- You can always extend the `spacing` key in the theme section of your `purgetss/config.js` file to add the missing values:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      spacing: {
        '13': '3.25rem',
        '15': '3.75rem',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Future plans
In future updates, we will be adding some of the new styles of TW 3, like [**Box Shadow Color**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow-color).

And we will try to match even more Titanium properties.
