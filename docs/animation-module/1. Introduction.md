## The Animation Module
:::info
**Purge TSS** includes an Animation module to apply simple 2D Matrix animations and transformations to any element, an array of elements, or even to individual children of an element.
:::

The Animation object describes the properties of an animation. It represents:
- A single-phase animation with an end state
- A multi-phase animation using the `open`, `close`, and `complete` modifiers
- Global states for children of a View using the `children` modifier

When the `play` method is called on a View, the View is animated from its current state to the state described by the `Animation` object. The properties that can be animated include the view's position, size, colors, transformation matrix, and opacity. You can control the pace of the animation and timing with classes like `duration-*` or `delay-*`.


## Available Methods
- `play`, `toggle`: To animate an element, an array of elements, or individual children of an element with the properties in the `Animation` object.
- `open`, `close`: Explicitly manage the opening and closing animations of your views.
- `apply`: Applies the properties instantly without an animation.
- `draggable`: Convert any View or an array of Views to draggable elements.


## Available Modifiers
- `open:`, `close:`, and `complete:` To set different properties for each state.
- `children:` To set global properties for all the children of a View.
- `child:` To set individual properties for each child of a View.
- `bounds:` To set boundaries within which the View can move inside its parent View.
- `drag:`, `drop:` To set different properties when dragging or dropping elements.


## Timing and Other Special Classes
- `delay-*`: To set a delay before the animation starts.
- `duration-*`: To set the duration of the animation.
- `rotate-*`: To set the rotation of the element.
- `scale-*`: To set the scaling of the element.
- `repeat-*`: To set the number of times the animation will be repeated.
- `zoom-in-*`, `zoom-out-*`: To set the zoom in or out of the element.
- `drag-apply`, `drag-animate`: To apply or animate the properties when dragging elements.
- `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-linear`, `ease-in-out`: To set the animation curve of the element.
- `vertical-constraint`, `horizontal-constraint`: Adds a vertical or horizontal constraint when dragging an element.


## Installation
Use the **`purgetss module`** command to install the module in the `lib` folder.

```bash
> purgetss module

# alias:
> purgetss m
```


## Usage
This is the most basic `Animation` object, equipped with a set of **Purge TSS** classes to animate any element. You can create as many `Animation` objects as you want, each with different properties to animate.

```xml
<Alloy>
  <Animation id="myAnimation" module="purgetss.ui" class="a-set-of-purgetss-classes-and-modifiers" />
</Alloy>
```

**You can set any position, size, colors, transformation, and opacity classes from `tailwind.tss`.**
